// FONT VALIDATION — the rules that decide whether an admin-supplied font can be written
// into CSS. Duplicated verbatim from rent-master-pwa/lib/font-validate.ts.
//
// The two repos deploy separately and share no package, so this file is copied rather than
// imported — the same arrangement lib/validate.ts already has. Keep them byte-identical:
// the backend refuses bad input on save, and the frontend refuses it again before it
// touches a stylesheet. Either one alone would be a single point of failure.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARDS. A font setting ends up inside `font-family:` and `url("…")`. A value
// that can close either one is arbitrary CSS on every page of the app — the same class of
// hole the analytics feature refuses to open by never accepting a script snippet (see
// components/analytics-gate.tsx). So: the family names are OURS, never the admin's, and the
// URL is checked structurally AND for the handful of characters that can terminate a rule.
